# RW-Abandoned-Ward
a WIP rainworld region


Planning:
region: abandoned ward.

color pallette:

	-upper rooms lots of gray-white tiles 
	-lower rooms more traditional gray-black tiles
	-bg: shaded citadel pieces, foggy blue sky


subregions:

	-east: beach and derelict drainage pipe. connects both to SH and SL
	-west: appartment complexes, balconies. connects both to HI and SH
	
	-center: consists of 3 main (interconnected) routes that connect east and west:
		-the upper route: empty tramways across roads leading to/from a centerpiece station
		-the center route: marble houses are connected by bridges spanning decrepit canals that used to help against flooding
		-the bottom route: a cramped underground sewer line that leads directly into SL
